# OSGi enRout Concurrency Example And More

This workspace is a compendium to the [Concurrency & more](http://enroute.osgi.org/appnotes/concurrency.html) application note.

It contains many examples and templates for common problems when using DS. All examples have a test class that exercises them so it is possible to try them out in the debugger.
